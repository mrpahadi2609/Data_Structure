        "- Purpose: The `filter()` function is used to construct a new iterable from elements of an existing iterable that satisfy a certain condition.\n",
        "- Usage: It evaluates each element in the iterable using a function that returns a Boolean value, keeping only the elements that meet the specified condition.\n",
        "- Example: If you have a list of numbers and you want to filter out only the even numbers, you can use `filter()` with a lambda function that checks for even numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, `map()` is for transforming elements, `reduce()` is for reducing elements to a single value, and `filter()` is for selecting elements based on a condition. Each function serves a distinct purpose in data manipulation and processing in Python."
